Project name: Handwritten Digit classfication

A deep learning based project that classifies the handwritten digits accurately, with the accuracy of 97%. 
For building the neural network, Sequential model of keras is used, and 3 layers are being added. With one Input and ouput layer each and an extra hidden layer.
Activation function used in the neural netwrok are relu and softmax(because it had multiple classes i.e.from 0-9)
The dataset used is 'mnist', which is a built in dataset in keras.
IDE used: Jupyter
